  - TODO: change this to csv (makes it easier to track diff history) - Note that the current csv version has less data (no counts) :-/
  - Public Domain.

- wordslist.csv - newer snapshot of words.hk data from https://words.hk/faiman/analysis/wordslist.csv
  - Public Domain.
  - Note that we are well aware of a multitude of various potential errors and
    (linguistically) controversial entries in the list. See "Decision Problem
    Avoidance" in README.md. Feel free to report errors, but PRs against this
    file will not be accepted since the file is downloaded directly from
    words.hk data source.

- edb_charlist.txt - list of Hong Kong common characters from EDB ( https://www.edbchinese.hk/lexlist_ch/ )

- wordshk_charlist.txt - list of canonical Hong Kong characters, maintained by words.hk
  - intended as a "patch" on edb_charlist.txt. Lines starting with '!' removes the entry from the edb list (if it exists there).
