# Hong Kong standard character allow-list
# Manually edited by editors of words.hk

# This is not an exhaustive list of (traditional) characters used in Hong Kong.
# Instead, we intend this to be as used as a reference to what words.hk considers
# as "canonical" character forms. However, the fact that a character is not in
# this list does not mean it is "invalid" (in fact you will find entries in
# words.hk that are not in this list). It may mean the character is not common
# enough for inclusion, alternatively, it may mean we prefer another variant
# from a dictionary point of view.
#
# We believe this list provides utility for checking against unintended uses of
# variant forms, typos (characters that look similar that are hard to spot
# visually), etc.
#
# We welcome suggestions for changes on this list, but inclusion of any character
# must satisfy the requirement that it is commonly used in modern Hong Kong
# contexts. -- words.hk
